# Practice Corner (Study Room)

The Practice Corner tab contains two subtabs for focused practice:

## Subtabs
- **Master Studies** - Planned studies of reference works from the library
- **Live Study** - Live or timed study sessions with embedded video content

## Component Files
- `Study_room.tsx` - Main component with sub-tab navigation
- `Study_room.css` - Styles for all Study Room components
- `MasterStudies.tsx` - Master studies grid and viewer
- `MasterStudyViewer.tsx` - Full-screen viewer for master study images
- `LiveStudy.tsx` - Embedded video player for live study sessions
- `Warmups.tsx` - Warm-up exercises (now used in Inspiration Board)

## Note on Warmups
The `Warmups.tsx` component has been moved to the **Inspiration Board** tab. The component file remains in this folder but is imported and rendered in `Inspiration/Inspiration.tsx` under the "Warm-ups" sub-tab.
